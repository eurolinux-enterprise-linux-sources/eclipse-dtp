<strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>. This package has been added as
part of a work in progress. There is no guarantee that this API will
work or that it will remain the same. Please do not use this API without
consulting with the DTP Open Data Access team.
</p>
Provides an utility component for accessing the capabilities registered by an 
ODA extension that implements the
<code>org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.oda.dynamicResultSet</code> extension point.
<br>
It provides the service to explore all ODA dynamicResultSet extensions, and access each 
extension's capabilities registered in its extension manifest.
It can be used by an ODA consumer and/or a data provider to discover 
a dynamicResultSet extension's capabilities.
<p>
Use the singleton <code>ResultExtensionExplorer</code> as the entry point of this utility.
